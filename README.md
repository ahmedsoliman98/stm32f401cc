# stm32f401cc
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of MCAL and HAL drivers for the STM32F041CC, designed to provide a solid foundation for developing embedded systems using the STM32F041CC microcontroller. The drivers are written in C and provide a high-level abstraction layer for the hardware peripherals, making it easier for developers to interact with the microcontroller. The MCAL drivers provide low-level access to the hardware peripherals, while the HAL drivers provide a higher-level API that is more user-friendly. The implementation is highly modular and configurable, allowing developers to easily customize the drivers to suit their specific needs. Additionally, the repository includes sample applications that demonstrate how to use the drivers in real-world scenarios. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced embedded systems developer, this repository provides a valuable resource for building high-quality, reliable systems using the STM32F041CC kit.
